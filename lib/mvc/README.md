The MVC pattern absolutely unimplementable in Flutter.

MVC is good for evironments where View and Controller are naturally separated. For example, in web applications, the View is HTML and the Controller is a server-side script. In Flutter, the View and Controller are in the same file, so the pattern is unimplementable.
